Trial:
1. Female Veteran Heart Failure - Stress data
Gerber and her team studied the data of 157,000 women Veterans over the age of 45 to examine the relationship between coronary artery disease and the presence of one or more mental health conditions. (Coronary artery disease causes a waxy substance called plaque — cholesterol deposits — to build up on the inside of your coronary arteries. These are the arteries that supply oxygen-rich blood to your heart.)

Survey:
1.Survey F36 & Measurements
The Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) was a 2-year observational study of patients with chronic conditions, conducted in a cross-sectional phase among 22,462 patients and in a longitudinal phase among 2349 patients (Tarlov et al. 1989). One of its two main purposes was to analyze how outcomes vary depending on factors such as the type of delivery system in which a patient receives care, clinician specialty training, and intensity of resource use. Another main purpose was to develop practical tools for monitoring patient outcomes and their determinants.
